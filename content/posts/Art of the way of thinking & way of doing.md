*The art of thinking & doing* \
we all know that being a human we need to do something.even if we don't do anything in physical our brain is continuously thinking or process some bullshit thoughts.yes,today i am talking about those thoughts.when we do a work once we think i did it one time but that's not the realty.we did it twice.At first we did in out brain and second by doing physicaly.so our work is combination of two steps first we think to do then we do in real.without thinking we can't perform any task (except muscle memory tasks).so, my point is that we human can think n number of posibility of doing any task.some of them are ethical and some of them might be unethical.so if unethical thoughts comes your mind,don't need to be worry you are normal.Any thought's that comes up you mind just check that if it's unethical then just drop that thought.
